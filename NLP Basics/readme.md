# SpaCy NLP

Welcome to the SpaCy NLP Basics project! This project serves as an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) using the SpaCy library. Below is a summary of the key components and tasks covered in this project:

## Project Overview

**Objective:** To demonstrate fundamental NLP tasks using SpaCy with the text document "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" by Ambrose Bierce.

### Project Components

1. **Tokenization**: We start by tokenizing the text, breaking it down into individual words and punctuation marks.

2. **Sentence Segmentation**: The document is segmented into sentences, and a list of sentences is created for further analysis.

3. **Accessing Sentences**: We showcase how to access specific sentences within the document, including the title, which is considered the first sentence.

4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Part-of-speech tagging is demonstrated to identify the grammatical roles of words in sentences.

5. **Matcher Usage**: A custom matcher is created to find occurrences of the phrase "swimming vigorously" in the text, handling spaces between words.

6. **Printing Surrounding Text**: The text surrounding each found match is printed to provide context.
